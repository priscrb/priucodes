Hi, I'm Priscilla! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Software Engineer, Computer Scientist and Curious Soul.
To give you a little background of my life, for many years I've been obsessed
with learning new things and building stuff that could make people's lives better,
and I figured out the best way to do that through computers & technology.
Learning new things is my passion and to use that energy to build meaningful
stuff is what drives me.
