I'm a Computer Scientist, Software Developer and Curious Soul currently working for [QRPoint](https://qrpoint.com.br).
To give you a little background of my life, for many years I've been obsessed with learning new things and building stuff that could make people's lives better, and I figured out the best way to do that through computers & technology. Learning new things is my passion and to use that energy to build meaningful stuff is what drives me.
